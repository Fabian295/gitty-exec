# Git exec repo

## What is Gitty
In stead of having to add and commit  every time, we can  now just run gitty and addd the commit message as a argumant after the two hivens.

Get all the dependencies 

```node.js
npm install
```
Then run gitty
and write your message as an argument

```node.js
npm run gitty -- commit message 
```
